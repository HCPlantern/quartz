# Introduction

> [!hint] Layout Algorithm
> **Each layout algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem.** The default *Flow* layout is meant to create digital documents; it's essentially the _Microsoft Word_ layout algorithm. Headings and paragraphs stack vertically as blocks, while things like text, links, and images sit inconspicuously within these blocks.
> 
> While *Flexbox* is all about *flexibility*. We can control whether items grow or shrink, how the extra space is distributed, and more.

# Flex direction

Flex direction determines the *primary axis*, and the *cross axis* that runs perpendicularly.

-  `flex-direction: row`:  *primary axis* runs horizontally, from left to right.
-  `flex-direction: column` : *primary axis* runs vertically, from top to bottom.

# Alignment

![](https://r2.hcplantern.top/2023/09/10/20230910-204914.gif)

> [!important] 4 Key Terms to Understand Alignment
> - `justify` — to position something along the _primary axis_.
>  - `align` — to position something along the _cross axis_.
>  - `content` — a **group** of “stuff” that can be distributed.
>  - `items` — **single** items that can be positioned individually.
## justify-content

We can change how children are distributed **along the primary axis** using the `justify-content` property:
- bunch all the items up in a particular spot (with `flex-start`, `center`, and `flex-end`)
- spread them apart (with `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`).

## justify-self

There's no `justify-self` because you cannot adjust one single element across the primary axis. 

> What would it mean for that middle piece to set `justify-self: flex-start`? There's already another piece there!
## align-items

**For the cross axis, We use the `align-items` property:** 
- flex-start, center, flex-end (same as justify-content)
- stretch, baseline (different with justify-content)

## align-self

`align-self` has all the same values as `align-items`. In fact, **they change the exact same thing.** `align-self` changes a single child element.  ` align-items ` is _syntactic sugar_, a convenient shorthand that automatically sets the alignment on all the children at once.

# Hypothetical size

![](https://r2.hcplantern.top/2023/09/10/20230910-210538.png)

- In *Flow* layout, `width` is a _hard constraint_.
- In _Flexbox_, however, the `width` property is more of a **suggestion** than a hard constraint.

> [!hint] CSS mental model
> > [!fail] wrong model
> > Think of the CSS language as a collection of properties
> 
> As we've seen, the `width` property behaves differently depending on the layout mode used!
> 
> > [!success] right model
> > CSS as a collection of layout modes. Each layout mode is an algorithm that can implement or redefine each CSS property. We provide an algorithm with our CSS declarations (key/value pairs), and the algorithm decides how to use them.

# Growing and Shrinking

## flex-basis

- In a Flex row, `flex-basis` does **almost the same thing** as `width`. In a Flex column, `flex-basis` does the same thing as `height`.
- `width` will always affect the horizontal size. It doesn't suddenly become `height` when we flip `flex-direction` from `row` to `column`. Same to height.

## flex-grow

`flex-grow` tells us how to allocate free space to child elements

## flex-shrink

**What if our children are _too big_ for their container?**

![](https://r2.hcplantern.top/2023/09/10/20230910-211858.gif)

Both items shrink, **but they shrink proportionally.** The first child is always 2x the width of the second child.

`flex-shrink` tells us how elements shrink when container is not enough big. To prevent elements from scaling down, set ` flex-shrink ` to 0. 

# Minimum Size

In addition to the _hypothetical_ size, there's another important size that the Flexbox algorithm cares about: _the minimum size_.

- Text inputs have a default minimum size of 170px-200px (it varies between browsers).
- For an element containing text, the minimum width is the length of the _longest unbreakable string of characters._

# Gap

Using `justify-content: space-between` cannot control space between child elements.  `gap` allows us to create space _in-between_ each Flex child. This is great for things like navigation headers:

![](https://r2.hcplantern.top/2023/09/10/20230910-212319.png)

`gap` is a relatively **new addition to the Flexbox language**. 

# Auto margins

- Earlier, we saw how the `flex-grow` property can gobble up any extra space, applying it to a child.
- Auto margins will **gobble up the extra space, and apply it to the element's margin.** It gives us precise control over where to distribute the extra space.

So both do the same thing. But why auto margins? 

> [!hint] Auto Margins
> The auto-margins solution treats the extra space _as a resource_, and deciding exactly where it should go. This solution makes space to become **margin** while the flex-grow solution gives free space to the **body**.

# Wrapping

- When we set `flex-wrap: wrap`, **items won't shrink below their hypothetical size**.
- Each row has its own **mini flex container** 

## align-content

When elements wraps, we can use it to _align the rows themselves._

> [!tldr] Summary
> - `flex-wrap: wrap` gives us two rows of stuff.
> - Within each row, `align-items` lets us slide each individual child up or down
> - Zooming out, however, we have these two rows within a single Flex context! The cross axis will now intersect _two_ rows, not one. And so, we can't move the rows individually, we need to distribute them _as a group_.
> - Using our definitions from above, we're dealing with _content_, not _items_. But we're also still talking about the cross axis! And so the property we want is `align-content`.
