- Sort $R$ and $S$ first. 
- Then perform tow-pointer-like algorithm: 

``` title="Join Tow Sorted Relation"
do {
	if (!mark) {
		while (r < s) { advance r }
		while (r > s) { advance s }
		// mark start of \block" of S
		mark = s
	}
	if (r == s) {
		result = <r, s>
		advance s
		yield result
	} else {
		reset s to mark
		advance r
		mark = NULL
	}
}
```

COST = $\text{cost to sort } R + \text{ cost to sort } S+ ([R] + [S])$

## Optimization

- You can combine the last sorting phase with the merging phase, provided you have enough room in memory to allocate a [[page]] for each run of $[R]$ and for each run of $[S]$.
- The final merge pass is where you allocate a [[page]] for each run of $R$ and each run of S. In this process, you save $2 âˆ— ([R] + [S])$ I/Os
